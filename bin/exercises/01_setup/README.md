# Exercise description

## Start your Cloud Foundry Trial

:bulb: **Note:** In case you don't have a free trial account on the SAP  Cloud Platform yet, follow this [step-by-step-tutorial](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) to get one.

1. Then in [SAP Cloud Platform cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) navigate to your user home. You should see a button *Start Cloud Foundry Trial*.

You are now in your Cloud Foundry trial space

## Cockpit
This is a simplified picture of the domain model you have in the Cloud Foundry Environment. If you want to learn more about the different entities, check the [documentation.](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377.html)

## Clean-up

:bulb: **Note:** There is a limited quota in the Cloud Foundry environment trial account.

In case you already used the trial account quota, you have to clean-up applications and service instances prior continuing with the exercises. You can do so via cockpit:
- navigate to the list of Applications running in your Space and delete all or stop all running applications;
- go to the Service Instances and delete all.   

## Local development environment

:bulb: **Note:** If you use the TechEd provided laptops then your local development environment tools listed below are already installed. In this case all you have to do is check whether it works and there are the proper versions. If you are using your own laptop, then make sure you install and setup the tools listed below in case you don't have them.

### Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CF CLI)
